# Football_Scala
Small Project where I tried to use Big Data technology (Spark with Scala and using RDD file) to predict the winning team for international football games.

I used a data set containing all the international football results from 1872 to 2021 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=results.csv)
